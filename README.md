This is a master repo for Natural Language Processing.

Natual Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. 

This master repo has been created in a motive to settle all the codes of NLP's major applications in a sigle repo, which would be a source for codes of baseline models till the state-of-art model for the newbees to this field.

The intention of this repo is majorly towards hepling the begginers in this field.Even if a single person is benifited the author would be happy and satisfied.
